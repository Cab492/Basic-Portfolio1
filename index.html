				<p>My name is Christian Barthlow. I am 23 years old and I live in Dallas, TX. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in May of 2017. I received a BA in Linguistics. After graduating I did not know what kind of career I wanted to enter. I spent some time studying to take the Texas Teacher's Exam. After a few months of preparing to be a teacher, I decided that it wasn't for me. I did some research and tried to think of ways to use my Linguistics degree to build a career. That is how I found Southern Methodist University's Coding Boot Camp. I started the program on October 25th, 2017 and I will graduate on April 28th, 2018! By the end of the program, I will become a full-stack developer.</p>

			<p>I have a wide range of interests and ideas for linking the tech world to my linguistic knowledge and hobbies. Some of my interst include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
				<li>American Sign Language</li>
				<li>Web Applications</li>
				<li>Mobile Applications</li>
				<li>Animals</li>
				<li>Tennis</li>
				<li>Pop Culture</li>
				<li>Music</li>
				<li>Religion</li>

			</ul>
